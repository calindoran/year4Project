# Slamtec Lidar Project: A.R.M Lidar System

This is the reposatory for my final year project in software development.

Hardware used:

Slamtec RPLiDAR A2M8


Software used:

C++
C++ is a cross-platformed language that can be used to create sophisticated high-performance applications. The language gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

•	This will be the main languge of the system and will be developing most if not all of the functionality of the system with this language.

RPLiDAR SDK
This is the library used for the LiDAR scanner, it allows for multiple commands and access to the LiDAR and its capabilities.

•	The SDK of the hardware used, RPLiDAR, is an integral part of this project as it allows for the development the system with the hardware.

Visual Studio 2019
Visual Studio is used to develop apps for Android, iOS, Windows, web, and cloud. It allows you to debug and diagnose with ease, test code, and release stable versions.

•	Our IDE, this allows us modern functionality and security while developing our system while allowing full compatability with new and older systems.

Visual Studio Code
When using multiple languages like Python and C++, or for cross-platform development, it can be a great editor tool. It provides the ability to debug and use version control through a multitude of extensions and addons on many platforms.

•	This will be used for some cross-platform testing to ensure support for the application.
